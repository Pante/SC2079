    """
    Finds the shortest path of a segment of the overall path.

    Uses an annotated A* pathfinding algorithm with a modified function for returning a vector's neighbour. Each grid
    cell contains a "true clearance" value which denotes the distance from an obstacle. These values are pre-computed to
    avoid re-computation during each run.

    See https://harablog.wordpress.com/2009/02/05/hierarchical-clearance-based-pathfinding/

    The possible neighbours are constrained by the current vector's direction and moves, i.e. FORWARD_LEFT, BACKWARD.
    Vectors that share the same x & y coordinates but different direction are considered different cells.

    The Euclidean distance between two vectors is used as the heuristic function.

    :param world: The world.
    :param initial: The initial vector. Always the south-west corner of the robot.
    :param objectives: The possible objective vectors. Always the south-west corner of objectives.
    :return:
        The cost of the segment.
        The vectors and corresponding instructions from the initial vector to the objective vector. Vectors that form
        a curve when turning are embedded inside the instruction
