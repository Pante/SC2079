class STM():
    """Class for communicating with STM32 microcontroller over UART serial connection.

    ### RPi to STM32
    RPi sends the following commands to the STM32.

    #### Path mode commands
    High speed forward/backward, with turning radius of `3x1`
    - `SFx`: Move forward `x` units
    - `SBx`: Move backward `x` units
    - `LF00`: Move to the forward-left location
    - `RF00`: Move to the forward-right location
    - `LB00`: Move to the backward-left location
    - `RB00`: Move to the backward-right location

    ### STM32 to RPi
    After every command received on the STM32, an acknowledgement (string: `ACK`) must be sent back to the RPi.
    This signals to the RPi that the STM32 has completed the command, and is ready for the next command.
